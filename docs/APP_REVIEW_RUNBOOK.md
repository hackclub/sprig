  * Ensure that the game is placed in the /games directory.
  * Ensure that the game screenshot is placed in the /games/img directory, and that the name of the image matches the name of the game file.
  * Ensure that the author has provided all information requested on header of the code (@title: @author: @tags: [] @img: @addedOn:).
  * Check plagiarism script (it should comment on PRs every time code is changed).  Ensure that it reports no overlaps greater than 50% with other games.
  * Navigate to the preview deployment of the game and ensure that the game is able to launch and displays (and is discoverable) as expected in the gallery.
  * Run the game.  Ensure that it has >= 1 minute of novel gameplay.


2. Communicate your review decision to the PR author via a code review
  * If you found an issue during your checklist, **Request changes** on the PR, and clearly communicate the issue or issues that the author needs to resolve before being able to land their changes.  After requesting changes, add the author to the current assignees.  Stop here.
  * If you determine that the game is ready to be landed, **Approve** the PR with a congratulatory comment.
  * Add a comment stating that if the author is a teen, they can request their Sprig device at https://sprig-order.hackclub.dev/.  You can also suggest to them to share a few sentences in our #ship Slack channel.
  * Merge the PR to main.
