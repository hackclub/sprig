# Assembling your Sprig

Your Sprig console is a piece of open source hardware and can also be used as a hardware development kit (all the unused GPIO pins are broken out!). We made it into a game console and invite you to enjoy it as such. But we encourage you to make it something else.

Below are instructions for assembling your Sprig console.

## Instructions

1. Connect the LCD screen to the pins on the top of the board.

2. Add spacers, put the longer screws through the holes, and screw the nuts on the back side.

3. Put 4 buttons in corresponding holes on each side of the board. You'll have 2 extra buttons.

4. Turn the board over, and put the clear backings on. The first piece should have a D-pad cutout; the solid piece should be on top. The screw holes and D-pad cutout may need to be cleared out. Make sure to peel off the protective film on the front and back of each piece.

5. Put the shorter screws in holes and add nuts on the top side of the board. Tighten using the allen key provided. Repeat for the clear backings on the other side.
