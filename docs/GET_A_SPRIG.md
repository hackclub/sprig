# Get a Sprig!

**Anyone can submit to the gallery, but read the details below if you want your very own Sprig.** If you have any questions, join #sprig on our [Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack)!

There are only a few requirements to get a Sprig console:

1. You must be in high school or younger (this will be checked before mailing)
2. Your game must use the Sprig editor
3. Your game has a minimum of 1 min of gameplay
4. Your game is original

Note: for games made by a group, we only ship ONE device. (One device per PR / game).

<small>* Hackers outside USA take note: Our aim is to ship everywhere except US-sanctioned and trade-/mail-restricted nations. While we do cover shipping costs, you may be subject to customs fees. We can't predict what those will be. Your device will be held up in your local customs until it is paid.</small>

Happy hacking!
