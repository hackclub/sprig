<img src="https://cloud-1kf29t9im-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img_3190.jpg" width="500">

`sprig_cover.f3d` is the Fusion 360 file for the back cover. The back covers can be secured with M2 x 10mm screws and hex nuts.

If you choose to fabricate the back covers using a laser cutter, you'll need 2 pieces which are `sprig_cover--dpad.dxf` and `sprig_cover--solid.dxf`. One piece has a d-pad cutout for the buttons. It's designed to be cut out of 1/8" or 3mm acrylic.

To fabricate the back covers using a 3D printer, you'll need to print 2 of the `sprig_cover--dpad.stl` and 2 of the `sprig_cover--solid.stl`.
