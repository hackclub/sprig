## Parts list

- [BackPlate.stl](./parts/BackPlate.stl) (3d printed): This is the back side of the case that comes in 2 parts: one part mirrored for the other side of the Sprig main board. It should be printed with the nut traps facing down.
- [FrontPlate.stl](./parts/FrontPlate.stl) (3d printed): This is the front side of the case that should be printed in multimaterial. It should be printed with the snowman emblem facing up.
- [Spacer.stl](./parts/Spacer.stl) (3d printed)
- M2x8mm screws (x8)
- M2 nuts (x8)

## Printing parts

It's recommended that all parts be printed in PLA, as the frontplate is multi-color. If PETG is substituted, all parts should be PETG, as PLA and PETG do not adhere to each other. 
All parts should be printed in PLA.  So far, we've used:

- Prusament PLA Vanilla White
- Prusament PLA White (substitute for vanilla white when vanilla white is out of stock)
- Prusament PLA Lipstick Red

The FrontPlate requires a color change on the last layer to print the snowman, snowflakes, and text in another color.
